# SE Core Template

A starter for **Software Engineering Core** — a parent/child engineering-process regime for developers running multiple Claude Code and Codex projects. SE Core gives you:

- **Cross-project rules in one place** (`core-rules/CLAUDE.md`) that every registered project inherits through Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/`) and Codex (`AGENTS.md` / `.agents/`) entrypoints.
- **Harness-specific hook stacks**: Claude Code uses `.claude/hooks/`; Codex uses `.codex/hooks.json` and `.codex/hooks/`; both share the same policy intent.
- **A process-gate skill** exposed through both `.claude/skills/process-gate` and `.agents/skills/process-gate` when Codex is enabled.
- **A scheduled audit fleet** (10 Tier-1 audits) that scans every registered project weekly/monthly for hook drift, dependency posture, test health, bypass attempts, and process compliance — writing reports to `audits/`.
- **A Rule-of-Three discipline** for adding new parent rules: candidates wait in `core-rules/deferred.md` until three independent projects adopt them.

Read `engineering-process.md` for the full narrative manual once you're set up.

## Quick start

You are about to clone this template and customize it for your own machine.

> **Two ways to set up.** Pick one.
>
> **(A) Agent-driven (recommended).** Open this repo in Claude Code or Codex, or paste the contents of [`AGENT_SETUP.md`](AGENT_SETUP.md) into an agent conversation that has filesystem tools. The agent will interview you, fill in the placeholders, ask whether to enable Codex parity, install inheritance symlinks, and seed hooks. ~10 minutes, no manual sed.
>
> **(B) Manual.** Follow [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) step by step. ~30 minutes, more sed.

## What you customize

Three placeholders appear throughout the repo. Setup replaces them in-place:

| Placeholder            | What it becomes                                                | Example                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `__SE_CORE_PATH__`     | Absolute path where you cloned this repo                       | `/path/to/se-core`                 |
| `__PROJECTS_ROOT__`    | Absolute path to the parent dir holding your projects          | `/path/to/projects`                |
| `__MAINTAINER_NAME__`  | Your name (used in `engineering-process.md`)                   | `Jane Doe`                         |
| `__GITHUB_USER__`      | Your GitHub username (referenced in audit-flow examples)       | `janedoe`                          |
| `__USER_HOME__`        | Your home directory (rare — only in a couple of legacy refs)   | `/home/jane`                       |

`AGENT_SETUP.md` walks an LLM through asking you for these values, choosing harnesses, and substituting them.

## Requirements

- **macOS or Linux** with `bash`, `git`, and `jq` on `PATH`. Hooks degrade gracefully if jq is missing.
- **Node.js** if any of your projects use husky-managed git hooks. (For Unity / Rust / Go / Python-only projects, see `core-rules/inheritance.md` "Native git hooks".)
- **Claude Code and/or Codex**. The default config enables both harnesses. Claude Code uses `.claude/`; Codex uses `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and `.codex/hooks/`. You can remove either harness from `se-core.config.json` if you intentionally do not use it.
- **Codex hooks opt-in** requires Codex CLI with hooks support and `[features] codex_hooks = true` in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`.
